# Data201-Arthas
Launch and fast prototyping
This is the phase of exploration and prototyping.

Exploration
As a team, you need to identify good set of data sources. A good datasource for this projects is a source of data that:

you can read and handle, or learn to read and handle in a very short time. Formats that are too exotique may be very interesting, but they may also require a too long time to import into anything familiar to you. To be fair, most of the datasets you can find in the sources we suggest you are in a good format. pro tip: avoid data presented in pdf tables, unless you are ready to do a lot of hand work (if you do, it's great).
it is not already in the most suitable data model. If the source dataset is already perfect, there's little you can do and you won't have the opportunity to exhibit your skills. Government or NGO data is usually quite dirty, so they represent good choices.
it is interesting for you. I don't have a strong interest in cars, and for me working a month on car data set would be a boring hell. But maybe you LOVE cars, than that dataset would be perfect for you. Try to consider your passions, or look at the news to see what may be a hot topic. Avoid abused datasets (i.e., iris or mtcars or titanic or ...): we have already seen all possible projects about that stuff.
it is joined or joinable to other data sources. Consider the presence of common identifiers (things as: region names, product ids, years or dates, ...) that you may use to connect two or more data sources and tell a story (great data stories often emerge from connections).
Suggested data sources
There's no hard boundary: if you do identify a data source we did not think about, even better.

Our data repositories suggestions are:

https://data.govt.nz/ : a large repository of New Zealand Governmental Datasets, in various formats, most of local interest.
http://www.who.int/gho/en/ : a database of information from the World Health Organization, of global interest.
http://data.un.org/ : a collection of databases from the United Nations, of global interest.
https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory : a directory of public data from Google.
https://www.gdeltproject.org: Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone: a comprehensive, high resolution open database of human society events.
Google offers (a beta version of) a search engine for finding datasets: https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch

Prototyping
You won't find the best data sources at the first go.

Once you have identified a candidate set of data sources, try and write down what use you want to make of it. A good way is to try and write down some question you would like to answer with the data sources (good questions are question that do require some wrangling and cannot be simply answered using only one of the data sources).

After that, prototype your data wrangling: you may decide to work on a limited subset of data to see you can quickly write some code to get closer to answering your questions. The code does not need to be perfect, nor the questions need to be answered at this stage. Yet, if the questions look to easy or too hard consider (1) changing question, or (2) changing data sources and questions.

Fail fast, fail often. Trying and hitting a wall as soon as possible you can avoid to find yourself stuck at the mid of your project.

2. Feedback Sessions
A feedback session is a collaborative effort between 2 groups.

In the first hour, group A will expose its sources, targets, work done and future plans to group B. Group B gives feedback about all the phases: they can suggest slightly improved questions, point toward possible weakness in the methodology (for example, data contamination risks, ...), rise ethical questions, and suggest solutions to problems group A is facing. After the first hour, groups swap roles.

3. group work
Unstructured time. You'll have the opportunity to work with the teachers and TAs to progress in your group project.

4. Presentations
Impress us! Tell us what you have done, and what is interesting in the data you wrangled. What wonderful very distant data sets you managed to get together and clean and make sense of. Tell us how the data model you shaped your data into allows for other data scientists to work on that data. Use animation, visualization and your best communication skills.

Presentation times 7 minutes + 1 minute for Q&A from the audience.

Presentation are marked separetely, and are worth 10% of the course final grade.
